# Bienvenue!

This is a starter kit to help you start a project for the [CFRP](http://cfregisters.org) hackathon quickly. Feel free to use as much or as little of these resources and ideas as you find useful.

> _Please note, this website is itself a [github repository](https://github.com/jamiefolsom/cfrp-hack/), and we would welcome your input on it. If you have ideas or questions, or you find problems, please [open a ticket](https://github.com/jamiefolsom/cfrp-hack/issues), or better yet, fork it, fix it, and open a [pull request](https://github.com/jamiefolsom/cfrp-hack/pulls)!_

Some suggested first steps.

## 1. Get familiar with the data

The project has generated a great deal of data. The first step to making use of it is to understand what it contains.

1. [Read the listing of data tables and definitions](/tables).
2. Install an [API browser](/tools) and Explore.
3. Ask questions about how data are structured if you have any. 

> _We can of course create views and aggregations from the existing data, if there are different schemata that are preferable. Don't hesitate to [make a recommendation](https://github.com/jamiefolsom/cfrp-hack/issues)._

## 2. Choose and define a project

On Friday afternoon, we'll have a chance to talk with researchers and other developers about possible project ideas. Choose one that interests you. Ask historians and developers any questions you have about how to proceed. In the meantime, have a look at some [suggested project categories](/ideas).

## 3. Hack!

### Set up
- Fork [this site](https://github.com/jamiefolsom/cfrp-hack/)
- Clone this repo locally; then:
- `git branch your-project`
- If there is a request in Postman that serves your purposes, you can click "Generate Code" to get a copy/pasteable API client in your language of choice.

### Run this site locally

- If you have ruby installed:
- `gem install bundler`
- `bundle install`
- `jekyll serve`

### Add your project to the site

- Code!
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "Created hackathon project"`
- `git push`
- Open a Pull request against [the upstream repo](https://github.com/jamiefolsom/cfrp-hack/pulls).
