# Bienvenue!

This is documentation for using the [CFRP](http://cfregisters.org) dataset. Feel free to use as much or as little of these resources and ideas as you find useful.

> _Please note, this website is itself a [github repository](https://github.com/jamiefolsom/cfrp-hack/), and we would welcome your input on it. If you have ideas or questions, or you find problems, please [open a ticket](https://github.com/jamiefolsom/cfrp-hack/issues), or better yet, fork it, fix it, and open a [pull request](https://github.com/jamiefolsom/cfrp-hack/pulls)!_

Some suggested first steps.

## 1. Get familiar with the data

The project has generated a great deal of data. The first step to making use of it is to understand what it contains.

1. [Read the listing of data tables and definitions](/tables).
2. Install an [API browser](/tools) and Explore.
3. OR, you can [run SQL queries against the data in denormalised form](/starschema)
4. Ask questions about how data are structured if you have any.

> _We can of course create views and aggregations from the existing data, if there are different schemata that are preferable. Don't hesitate to [make a recommendation](https://github.com/jamiefolsom/cfrp-hack/issues)._

## 2. View a sample project
