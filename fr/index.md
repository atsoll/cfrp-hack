# Survol

This is documentation for using the datasets compiled by the **Comédie Française Registers Project** from the [receipt registers](https://www.cfregisters.org/en/registers/receipt-registers), the [casting registers](https://www.cfregisters.org/en/registers/casting-registers), and the [expense registers](https://www.cfregisters.org/en/registers/expense-registers).

The project is also working on 19th Century receipts, as well as the 17th and 18th century ones. The registers themselves are held in bound volumes at the archives at the Comédie Française theater (CF) in Paris, France. These data were compiled by hand, using a web-based data entry application.

This website presents documentation for each of those sets of registers.

- [Receipt Registers](/receipts/)
- [Casting Registers](/feux/)

### Publications

These data have been used in an article published by the MIT Press: [*"Databases, Revenues, & Repertory
The French Stage Online, 1680-1793"*](https://cfrp.mitpress.mit.edu/).
