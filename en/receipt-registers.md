## Receipt Registers

The data extracted from the receipt registers are covered in this section. They represent the income generated by the theater, day by day, performance by performance, over the course of the 113 year period.

There are three ways to access this data; the API is the preferred method, but it's also possible to download some samples of data as JSON files, and also to install a complete copy of the data set into PostgreSQL.
